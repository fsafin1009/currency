# Currency Converter Web Application

This is a simple web application for converting currencies using jQuery, AJAX, and PHP with Bootstrap for styling the front-end.

## Features
- Convert currencies using a server-side API (you will need to implement your own conversion logic or use an external conversion API).
- Interactive client-side user interface.
- Responsive design for all devices.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you'll need:

1. A web server running PHP, such as [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/), or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/).
2. A browser supporting JavaScript and modern web standards.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the .zip file and extract its contents.
2. Move the project folder to your web server's public directory.
   - For XAMPP, move it to `<installation_path>/htdocs`.
   - For WAMP, move it to `<installation_path>/www`.
   - For MAMP, move it to `/Applications/MAMP/htdocs`.

3. Start your web server and navigate to the project within your browser:
   - For XAMPP or WAMP: `http://localhost/<project_folder_name>/`
   - For MAMP: `http://localhost:8888/<project_folder_name>/`

4. The currency converter web application should now be up and running.

## Usage

1. On the main page, enter the amount you want to convert in the 'Price' field.
2. Choose the 'From' and 'To' currencies using the dropdown lists (you will need to add currency options in the `index.html` file).
3. Press the 'Convert' button to perform the currency conversion.
4. The converted amount will be displayed below the 'Result' heading.

## Customization

To implement your own conversion logic or integrate with an external conversion API, modify the `convert.php` file with your code or API call.
